      <h4> About </h4>
      <p> Mapping Events is an online archive of map screenshots by <a href="https://weixizeng.com" target="_blank">Weixi Zeng </a> </p>
      <p> This collection got its name from the fact that I ended up with four key projects after my first venture into web design. These four projects are like windows, offering unique outlooks into the massive and sophisticated world of designing for the Internet. Sitting inside these four windows, I gained knowledge yet am still mostly confused at the constantly-expanding landscape in front of me. Will someone who always sits within windows ever truly understand whatever goes on outside these windows?  </p>
