      <h4> About </h4>
      <p> Mapping Events is an online archive of map screenshots made by <a href="https://weixizeng.com" target="_blank">Weixi Zeng </a> </p>
      <p> This collection got its name from the fact that I ended up with four key projects after my first venture into web design. These four projects are like windows, offering unique outlooks into the massive and sophisticated world of designing for the Internet. Sitting inside these four windows, I gained knowledge yet am still mostly confused at the constantly-expanding landscape in front of me. Will someone who always sits within windows ever truly understand whatever goes on outside these windows?  </p>
      <p> Weixi Zeng is a graphic and motion designer hailing from the School of Visual Arts in New York. He is always dedicated to creating insightful designs that tell great stories, crafting typographic elements and making them move. Currently he is pursuing a MFA degree in Graphic Design at the Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
